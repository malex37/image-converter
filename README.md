# image-converter

A (probably another) cli tool to convert images between formats.

You might be asking "why another cli tool" and my answer is: I don't know, why not.

Sure there's things like ffmpeg which have a lot of power, but it also feels like using a nuke to kill a cockroach. So here's a command line tool, that can be made extensible, to add single contained converting functions.
